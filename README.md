# Transactional html emails

## GOOGLE PLAY: RECEIPT CONFIRMATION
Many customers want a confirmation email to verify their payment transactional was completed. Unfortunately, not enough companies practice this policy. This confirmation of a monthly payment is being sent to a service subscriber of DD Studios. This transactional email also offers several quick links to commonly visited web pages on their website.

## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
